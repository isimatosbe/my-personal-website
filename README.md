# Description
This website is meant to be a web CV and a showcase for interesting projects that I made. As of 29/12/24 the [website](https://isimatosbe.es/) is already in production!

# Roadmap

    - [x] Name
    - [x] Information: Basic information, creating sections like:
        - [x] About Me
        - [x] Experience
        - [x] Education
        - [x] Certifications
        - [x] Skills

    - [x] Menu: Option to move between sections (My first idea was to display it as a folder with the sections marked in the right side of the website).
