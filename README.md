# Description
This website is meant to be a web CV and a showcase for interesting projects that I made. As of 29/12/24 the [website](https://isimatosbe.es/) is already in production!

# Roadmap
My main goal is to get this website to the MVP (v1.0) from that point onwards it will help me improve but it will be useful and sharable.

    - [x] Name
    - [x] Information: Basic information, creating sections like:
        - [x] About Me
        - [x] Experience
        - [x] Education
        - [x] Certifications
        - [x] Skills

- v0.4: Menu & Projects section
    - [x] Menu: Option to move between sections (My first idea was to display it as a folder with the sections marked in the right side of the website).
    - [x] Projects section: Submenu to showcase new projects I start. The first thing to add is a history of this website with every version available.

- ~~v0.7: Optimize building~~: Right now the website is very small, around 200kB of code, so I won't be needing any more optimizing. Part of this is because I have been building all the components instead of importing them. 
- v1.0: This will be the MVP.
    - [x] Making sure everything looks nice, clean and the information is correct.
    - [x] Splitting CSS
