# Description
This website is meant to be a web CV and a showcase for interesting projects that I made. As of 29/12/24 the [website](https://isimatosbe.es/) is already in production!

# Roadmap
My main goal is to get this website to the MVP (v1.0) from that point onwards it will help me improve but it will be useful and sharable.

- v0.1: Name & Information
    - [x] Name
    - [x] Information: Basic information, creating sections like:
        - [x] About Me
        - [x] Experience
        - [x] Education
        - [x] Certifications
        - [x] Skills

- v0.4: Menu & Projects section
    - [x] Menu: Option to move between sections (My first idea was to display it as a folder with the sections marked in the right side of the website).
    - [ ] Projects section: Submenu to showcase new projects I start. The first thing to add is a history of this website with every version avaliable.
- v0.5: Finishing touches:
    - [ ] Up Arrow to move back up
    - [ ] Dark Mode
    - [ ] Spanish Version
    - [ ] Create color palette
    - [ ] Footer
- v0.6: Making the web responsive
- v1.0: Making sure everything looks nice and clean. This will be the MVP. 
- v2.0: Learning TypeScript and updating the website to TS.
