# Description
This website is meant to be a web CV and a showcase for interesting projects that I made. As of 29/12/24 the [website](https://isimatosbe.es/) is already in production!

# Roadmap
My main goal is to get this website to the MVP (v1.0) from that point onwards it will help me improve but it will be useful and sharable.

- v0.1: Name & Information
    - [x] Name
    - [x] Information: Basic information, creating sections like:
        - [x] About Me
        - [x] Experience
        - [x] Education
        - [x] Certifications
        - [x] Skills

- v0.2: Photo & Socials
    - [x] Photo
    - [x] Socials: Adding links to GitHub, LinkedIn and mail
- v0.3: Add formating and styling
    - [ ] Aesthetic skills display
    - [ ] Uniform and clean section style
    - [ ] Uniform and simple item style
- v0.4: Menu & Projects section
    - [ ] Menu: Option to move between sections, my first idea is to display it as a folder with the sections marked in the right side of the website.
    - [ ] Projects section: Submenu to showcase new projects I start. The first thing to add is a history of this website with every version avalible.
- v0.5: Small details:
    - [ ] Up Arrow to move back up
    - [ ] Dark Mode
    - [ ] Spanish Version
- v1.0: Making sure everything looks nice and clean. This will be the MVP.
