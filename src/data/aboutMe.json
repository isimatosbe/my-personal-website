    "description": "I am a Mathematician who is really interested in the computational aspects of mathematics, that is why I got my Master's degree on Logic, Computer Science and Artificial Inteligence at the University of Seville. For the last year and a half I have been working at Telefónica de España, at the Planification and Digitalization at the Basic Infrastructures department, where I am mainly focused on automatization (using Python) and data analysis and visualization (using Python, PowerBI and SQL)."
